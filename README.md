#### This bivariate map illustrates greenspace development priority, ranging from very low priority to very high priority, for each census block group in Charlotte, NC (Mecklenburg County). Development priority was determined based on four factors: number of intentional deaths (homicides and suicides), amount of existing greenspace, and neighborhood racial and economic demographics. I developed this map in response to a [NewScientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933270-800-green-spaces-arent-just-for-nature-they-boost-our-mental-health-too/) article summarizing recent findings relating to the greenspace-mental health relationship and the need for more public greenspaces. The article, and recent research, suggest greenspaces may be protective for mental health.

#### I created this bivariate map in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, utilizing Leaflet and JQuery libraries in Atom. The map includes neighborhood greenspace development priority displayed as choropleth; with 5 discrete categories (very low priority-very high priority), and existing parks and greenspaces are indicated with icons. To encourage interaction, I included 3 interactive features: users can hover over a neighborhood (census block group) to learn more about the number of intentional deaths, and racial and economic demographics of the neighborhood; users can click on a neighborhood to zoom to it; users can click on a greenspace icon to learn more about the park itself.
